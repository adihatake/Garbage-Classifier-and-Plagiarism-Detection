# CYSF 2020 and 2021 Source Code Repository

This single repository outlines the source code for my CYSF 2020 and CYSF 2021 entries.

During 8th grade, I developed a garbage classifier using the Google Vision API. It can identify a multitude of common waste items using its 
camera and inform users which bin the garbage should be diposed in with its LCD. 

The following year, I created an algorithm using Natural Language Processing to catch students who commit academic dishonesty in their written assignments. Using word-embeddings, n-grams, POS, stylometry and 13 total features, I was able to obtain a 67% test accuracy.

Both projects have received local awards and recognition.
